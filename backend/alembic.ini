[post_write_hooks]
# post_write_hooks defines scripts or Python functions that are invoked
# automatically after a new revision file has been written.
#
# Format: <hook_name> = <function specification>
# where <function specification> specifies either a command to run or
# a Python function to call.
#
# For commands, format is:
#   <hook_name> = console_scripts:<name>
# where <name> is a console entrypoint defined by a setuptool entrypoint.
# The hook will be provided the absolute path to the newly generated file.
#
# For Python functions, format is:
#   <hook_name> = <fully qualified Python path>
# where <fully qualified Python path> is a function that accepts a single
# string argument, which is the absolute path to the newly generated file.
